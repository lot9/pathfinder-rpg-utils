# Pathfinder RPG - Utility Scripts
This repository contains scripts that make playing, running, or creating Pathfinder games easier.

The creator of these scripts as well as the scripts themselves have no connection or affiliation with the official Pathfinder trademark or with Paizo Publishing.

### character-sheets
Currently, the scripts in this folder can generate blank LaTeX character sheets for the Pathfinder RPG. I hope to expand the functionality of these scripts to allow users to create complete complete characters.

### data-mining/bestiary
The scripts in this folder can produce an SQLite database of creatures from the Pathfinder RPG by scraping the Bestiary pages of http://www.d20pfsrd.com (see the [wiki page](https://github.com/lot9s/pathfinder-rpg-utils/wiki/Data-Mining-%7C-Bestiary) for more details)
