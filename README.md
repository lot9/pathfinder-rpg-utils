# Pathfinder RPG - Utility Scripts
This repository contains scripts that make playing, running, or creating Pathfinder games easier.

### data-mining/bestiary
The scripts in this folder can produce an SQLite database of non-3rd party creatures from the Pathfinder RPG by scraping the Bestiary pages of http://www.d20pfsrd.com (see the [wiki page](https://github.com/lot9/pathfinder-rpg-utils/wiki/Data-Mining-%5C-Bestiary) for more details)
